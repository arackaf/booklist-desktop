## Booklist Desktop

This is a desktop admin application for my booklist site, made with QT, and C++ 17. It's basically a side project to help me learn C++.  It doesn't do much, yet, but there's plenty of examples of modern C++ being put to good use.

The UI widgets will eventually be made with QT, of course, with the data coming from the GraphQL endpoint on my main booklist site, serialized by [nlohmann's JSON serializer](https://github.com/nlohmann/json).

More to come!
